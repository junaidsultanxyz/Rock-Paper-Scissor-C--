I made this ROCK PAPER SCISSOR game in c++ for practice
i tried my best to avoid any errors

there can be some improvements made like deleting the last input if we get error, but ofc i will learn it soon and apply it

if there can be made some code cleanup like in functions or u have some better ideas, do let me know as it will help me alot :D
